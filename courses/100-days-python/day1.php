				<h2><b>What is Programming?</b></h2>
				<p>Welcome to my course on Python programming. If you know me, you know that I always
					start a
					beginner Python class with a fundamental question - "What is Programming". <br>
					Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. The computer is a very
					dumb
					machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn to program and
					tell
					computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to
					calculate 5+6,
					you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?<Br>
					You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the
					same.
					This 100 days of code series will help you learn Python from starting to the
					end. We
					will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a
					Job ready
					Python developer!</p>
				<h2><b>What is Python?</b></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Python is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that
						supports an
						object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming
						approach.</li>
					<li>Python is an interpreted (meaning, source code of a Python program is
						converted into
						bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine) and
						high-level
						programming language.</li>
					<li>It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><b>Features of Python</b></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Python is simple and easy to understand.</li>
					<li>It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
					</li>
					<li>Python is an open-source programming language.</li>
					<li>Python provides very big library support. Some popular libraries include
						NumPy,
						Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.</li>
					<li>It is possible to integrate other programming languages within Python.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><b>What is Python used for</b></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical
						representations.
					</li>
					<li>Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for
						insights and
						trends.</li>
					<li>It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to
						learn from
						past data without hard coding.</li>
					<li>It is used to create web applications.</li>
					<li>It can be used to work with databases.</li>
					<li>It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical
						operations
						along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In this tutorial, we will use Replit to create a Python program</p>

				<h2><b>Why Replit?</b></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Replit is an online IDE that is very easy to write code.</li>
					<li>Replit also offers a very robust mobile app that works great (Personal
						experience)
					</li>
					<li>You can easily fork <a
							href="https://replit.com/@arhanansari2009/01-Day1-Intro-to-Python?v=1">this
							repl</a> and continue learning in your own style.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><b>Setting up Replit</b></h2>
				<p>Now, We will start using Replit and learn step by step:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Step 1: Open your web browser and visit the <a
							href="https://www.replit.com">Replit website:</a></li>
					<img src="https://cwh-full-next-space.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/videos/python-100-days-of-code-1/image4.jpg"
						?>
					<li>Step 2: Replit page will appear, Click on Sign In, and create your new
						account, If you already have an account, click on Log In.</li>
					<li>Step 3: After logging into your account, click on "Create Repl"</li>
					<img
						src="https://cwh-full-next-space.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/videos/python-100-days-of-code-1/image7.jpg">
					<li>Step 4: This dialog box will appear, search for Python and click on "Python"
						from the dropdown </li>
					<img
						src="https://cwh-full-next-space.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/videos/python-100-days-of-code-1/image9.jpg">
					<li>Step 5: Give the name of the new Repl in the title and click on "Create
						Repl"</li>
					<img
						src="https://cwh-full-next-space.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/videos/python-100-days-of-code-1/image2.jpg">
					<li>Step 6: This page will appear and by default, the main.py file will be
						present in the replit template. This is where you can start writing
						python code</li>
					<img
						src="https://cwh-full-next-space.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/videos/python-100-days-of-code-1/image3.jpg">
					<li>Step 7: In the main.py file, write print(“Hello World”), and click on the
						Run button, to show the output on the Console box</li>
					<img
						src="https://cwh-full-next-space.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/videos/python-100-days-of-code-1/image1.jpg">
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>This is how you can create a program in Python and run it on the console. The output
					will look something like this:</p>
